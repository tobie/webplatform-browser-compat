  [WebPlatform.org](http://WebPlatform.org) expressed the wish to incorporate
  compatibility tables on the website, and provide the compatibility data through
  an easy to use API. [testthewebforward.org](http://testthewebforward.org) is
  organizing a similar effort to expose the data it's going to collect through
  running the [Web Platform W3C test suites](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests).
  Standardizing on a data model will help sync both of these efforts and allow
  sourcing data from multiple other sources that would adopt this data exchange model.

<section id="introduction">
  Defining a data model is tricky because different data sources have vastly
  different types of data. Some of this data is very much factual. For example,
  User Agent with UA string `uas` gets a score of `X` out of `Y` running the
  test suite `T` for spec `S` on date `t0`. Let's call this *raw data*. While this
  data is pretty much non-controversial, it is also not very valuable to the
  end-developer. Interpreting this data to conclude that User Agent `A` supports
  feature `F` is where the real value lies. Let's call this *interpreted data*.

  Ideally, we'd always be storing raw data. Unfortunately, that is not always
  possible. The challenge therefore consists in devising data models and
  transformation strategies which allow both raw and interpreted data to
  co-exist and be used together.

Format
------

The data format is [[JSON]].

User Agent data models
----------------------

### Reference User Agent Parser

Precisely identifying User Agents is a tricky business as camouflaging their true
identity and impersonating others has been among User Agent's
[earliest survival techniques](http://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/).

Despite it's flaws, User Agent String parsing remains the best technique to
identify browsers for analytics or testing purposes.

Properly parsing a User Agent string is a dirty job and not one that could be
specified easily. With specifying a UA parsing algorithm out of the question, our
second best bet is to standardize on <dfn>reference UA parser</dfn> that fits our licensing requirements and doesn't tie us to one programming language:
[`ua-parser`](https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser), the open-source parser extracted
from the [Browserscope](http://www.browserscope.org/) project. It has
[liberal licensing](https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser#license) and is polyglot by
nature: the core of the parser is a
[list of regexes](https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/blob/master/regexes.yaml) which
can be used to implement the parser in any language that supports regular expressions
and is able to consume [[YAML]] (disclaimer, the editor of this document is also `ua-parser`'s co-maintainer).
Currently, implementations exist in: C#, D, Go, Haskell, Java, JavaScript (node.js), Perl, PHP, Pig, Python, and Ruby.

### Incomplete Version Strings in <a>UserAgentInfo</a> and <a>OperatingSystemInfo</a>

<p class="issue">How do we handle incomplete version strings?

Consider `uainfo`,  an instance of <a>UserAgentInfo</a>. Its `family` attribute is `"Foo"`;
its `major` attribute, `"8"`; and its `minor` and `patch` attributes are both `null`. For
the sake of argument, imagine we represent this User Agent as the string "Foo 8".
Now consider `Feature` `f` which is determined to be supported by "Foo 8.1", but not by
"Foo 8.0". Do we consider it is supported by "Foo 8" or not?</p>

### The `UserAgent` object

The <a>UserAgentInfo</a>, <a>OperatingSystemInfo</a> and <a>DeviceInfo</a> objects
are usually obtained programmatically by parsing a User Agent string using the
<a>reference UA parser</a>. However, these objects can also be manually authored.
In such cases, their `family`, `brand` and `model` attributes MUST be a possible
output value of the <a>reference UA parser</a> in order for the data set to be
interoperable. So for example, if the <a>reference UA parser</a> identifies
Internet Explorer's family as as `"IE"`, a manually authored <a>UserAgentInfo</a>
object which would identify it as `"MSIE"` would **not** conform.

<p class="issue">
  A list of possible values for the <a>UserAgentInfo</a>, <a>OperatingSystemInfo</a>
  and <a>DeviceInfo</a> `family`, `brand` and `model` attributes must be
  reverse-engineered from the <a>reference UA parser</a> and maintained.

If the value of the `family` attribute is `"Other"`, the value of the `major`, `minor` and `patch` attributes MUST be `null`.

If the value of the `major` attribute is `null`, the value of the `minor` and `patch` attributes MUST be `null`.

If the value of the `minor` attribute is `null`, the value of the `patch` attribute MUST be `null`.
